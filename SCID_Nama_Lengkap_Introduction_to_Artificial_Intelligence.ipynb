        "teks_olaharaga = \"The final Merseyside derby of Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool reign might well be remembered as the final blow to his dream of signing off with the Premier League title. For the first time in 14 years, and the first time against Klopp, Everton were triumphant against their local rivals at Goodison Park. Victory tasted all the sweeter for Sean Dyche’s team for almost certainly securing their top-flight status at the expense of Liverpool’s title shot. “You lost the league at Goodison Park,” the home crowd bellowed as they rejoiced in a deserved Everton victory, an outstanding Everton performance and the best night of Dyche’s often-troubled reign. The imperious Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals that consigned Liverpool to a hugely damaging defeat. Quite simply, Everton wanted it more. That is damning of the team that arrived with designs on the title and in need of responding to Arsenal’s emphatic defeat of Chelsea the night before. Liverpool have faltered at the worst possible time and in the worst possible places from their perspective. Everton and Manchester United will savour their contributions to the slump. Dyche’s players were fired up and Goodison responded in kind. The old ground pulsated as Everton performed with an intent, intensity and quality that has been absent too often this season. Where has this team been? Calvert-Lewin, an injury doubt on the eve of the game, led the line superbly. It was no coincidence that the supply to the centre-forward improved greatly too. Jack Harrison and Dwight McNeil delivered the service that Calvert-Lewin craves while working tirelessly to help Idrissa Gana Gueye and James Garner assert control in midfield. Liverpool were rattled and vulnerable long before Branthwaite gave Everton an overdue lead. Liverpool were missing Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo, the latter joining the injured striker on the sidelines after his partner went into labour hours before kick-off. They were also missing composure for long periods and a clinical touch in front of goal, with the toils of Darwin Núñez and Mohamed Salah continuing. Abdoulaye Doucouré had already spurned a good chance to sidefoot Everton ahead when the 244th derby had its first flashpoint. Harrison put Calvert-Lewin through on goal with a delightful cross with the outside of his foot. The striker nudged the ball around Alisson and was sent sprawling by the Liverpool goalkeeper before he could convert. The referee Andy Madley pointed to the penalty spot and showed Alisson a yellow card, to the fury of the home crowd. Their mood deteriorated further when VAR found that Calvert-Lewin was offside. No penalty and no yellow card. The reprieve did not shake Liverpool out of their lethargy. Ben Godfrey launched himself into a vital challenge to prevent Núñez or Curtis Jones converting a first-time cross from Salah, but Everton remained in the ascendancy until the final 15 minutes of the first half. Godfrey headed wide when well-placed at a McNeil free-kick. Another McNeil free-kick found its way to Calvert-Lewin via James Tarkowski but Alisson saved the striker’s close-range header. It was third time lucky for McNeil free-kicks when another needless Liverpool foul, this time Jones on Gueye, presented the winger with one more opportunity to worry the visiting defence. Klopp’s team seemed blissfully unaware of Everton’s prowess at set pieces. The initial delivery was cleared to Tarkowski, who hooked the ball back across the area to Harrison. His first-time touch teed up Godfrey and, though his shot was blocked, the rebound fell invitingly for Branthwaite lurking unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box. The defender’s low shot squirmed under Alisson, rolled against the inside of a post and trickled in. There was another VAR check for offside but, after a lengthy delay, Everton were not denied a second time. Now Liverpool responded. Klopp’s side finally began to control possession and stretch the Everton defence. Jordan Pickford saved from Núñez when the Uruguay international was played through by Salah. The Everton keeper also denied Luis Díaz with his legs. Nunez created a clear opening for Salah but, having scuffed his initial shot against Branthwaite, Liverpool’s leading goalscorer skied the rebound wastefully. Everton also mounted fierce resistance in the face of Liverpool’s belated pressure. Branthwaite and Gueye threw themselves in the way of goalbound shots. Tarkowski dominated his penalty area, repelling numerous crosses. The pattern continued after the restart but, from their first break of note, Everton found the luxury of a second goal. McNeil stung Alisson’s fingertips with a powerful drive from 25 yards. From the resulting corner, taken deep by McNeil, Calvert-Lewin soared into a gap left by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk to head into the bottom corner. Liverpool, their title hopes fading, peppered the Everton area with crosses but frequently struck a royal blue shirt or found one closing them down inside the box. Díaz did beat Pickford but his curler from the left smacked the inside of the far post and bounced away. Pickford also denied Harvey Elliott and Salah late on as Everton secured a famous victory and Alexander-Arnold, sat on the bench, buried his head in his shirt. The image captured the pain of every Liverpool supporter.\"\n",
        "teks_kesehatan = \"The US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had detected viral particles of H5N1 avian influenza in milk purchased at grocery stores, but the agency says it still believes that the milk is safe to drink. In an update about an ongoing outbreak of bird flu in cattle, the FDA noted that it believes the viral particles were detected by highly sensitive lab tests and are likely to have been remnants of viruses killed during the pasteurization process. The agency said that it does not think it is likely that the particles would able to infect people but it is conducting additional tests to be completely sure. The FDA said these egg inoculation tests are “a gold-standard” for determining whether a virus is still viable and able to infect people. “To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,” the agency said. Dr. Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the finding of viral particles in milk on grocery store shelves means the outbreak is probably more widespread than we’ve known. “The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,” Topol said in an email Tuesday. “The FDA assurance that the dairy supply is safe is nice, but it’s not based on extensive assessment yet, which they acknowledge, and won’t engender trust and confidence because it comes in the wake of USDA mishandling,” he added. The US Department of Agriculture confirmed in late March that it had detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, which was the first time a virus that has been decimating bird populations around the globe had shown up in cattle. Since then, infected cows have been confirmed in more than 30 farms across eight states. Scientists have said the USDA is sharing too little information about the virus and too slowly. The infected cows stopped eating as much as they usually did, and their milk became thickened and discolored. Veterinarians running tests on the animals found that the milk was teeming with the virus, although samples from their lungs didn’t show much evidence of infection, leading the doctors to believe that the animals’ mammary glands were directly infected, perhaps through shared milking equipment. Researchers are still trying to determine how cows initially became infected and how the virus is spreading between animals. Cats that have lived on the same farms as infected cows have died, perhaps after exposure to their milk. The FDA said Tuesday that milk from sick cows is being “diverted or destroyed,” while milk sold in interstate commerce is being pasteurized, a process that heats it briefly to kill microbes. “Even if virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,” the FDA stated. The agency said 99% of milk in the commercial supply comes from farms that follow the pasteurized milk ordinance, “which includes controls that help ensure the safety of dairy products.” However, it noted that pasteurization doesn’t render milk completely sterile. For that reason, it has been running tests on milk samples collected at grocery stores across the country. It is also collaborating with the food safety group at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA has long recommended that consumers not drink unpasteurized or raw milk because of the possibility that it may harbor germs that can pose serious health risks. So far, efforts to track the spread of the current oubreak have relied on voluntary reporting. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service keeps a list of diseases that are required to be reported in animals. Although avian influenza, or bird flu, is required to be reported in poultry and wild birds, reporting is not required in cattle. “No one ever thought it was going to be in cows,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization’s coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. “You wouldn’t even think of an H5N1 in cows being something you’d ever have to worry about, and I think that’s where it’s fallen through the cracks a little bit.” Not only does the USDA require reporting of H5N1 in poultry, it rewards producers for reporting at the first sign of illness in their flock and financially compensates them for birds and eggs that are destroyed to contain an outbreak. This approach has encouraged farmers to be forthcoming with information, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. There are no such policies in place to encourage reporting in other livestock. Osterholm said his major worry is that the outbreak could spread to pigs, since farms that keep cows often keep other types of animals, too. Flu viruses enter cells through sialic acids, which serve as entry points. Right now, the H5N1 virus hasn’t learned to efficiently access the human version of the sialic acid receptor. Pigs have the same sialic acid receptors as both birds and humans in their respiratory tracts. If H5N1 causes a large outbreak in pigs, Osterholm said, it would give the virus a perfect opportunity to learn to attach to human sialic acids. “Pigs are a more efficient mixing bowl,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “The one thing about where we are in Texas is that, in addition to those cattle, Texas is the epicenter of the feral hog population.” “In the United States, we have 30% of the nation’s feral hogs, 2 to 3 million feral hogs, and so that to me is a potential risk, as well,” he said. The USDA said it has encouraged farmers and ranchers to report cases of sick cattle to state animal health officials. But neither cows nor the people who work or live around them are being widely screened for the infection, which would require informed consent. Testing of wastewater in areas with outbreaks is also being discussed. Instead, the CDC is monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis. “So far, these data remain in expected ranges, and to date, surveillance systems do not show any unusual trends or activity,” according to information in a statement compiled by officials at the CDC. CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said that 23 people with exposures to H5N1 had been tested, including one person in Texas who previously tested positive. No other people have tested positive in the current outbreak, he said.\"\n",
        "teks_keuangan = \"2024 is already close to being halfway over. The stock market continues to flirt with all-time highs while interest rates are till hovering near the peak of last year. With all the uncertainty in the economy, many investors are still cautious where to park their money. While the “best” place is largely dependent on your financial goals, here are the eight most promising avenues for investing your hard-earned money for the rest of 2024. 1. Conquering Debt Kicking things off, let’s talk about the elephant in the room - debt. Staring at a collective household debt surpassing $17.5 trillion in the US had me wanting to hurl. With average household debt over $104,000 and credit card debt hitting the $1.13 trillion mark, it's clear: the path to financial freedom starts with tackling debt head-on. For me, realizing that paying off debt is a guaranteed return on investment was a game-changer. It didn’t mean that I had to have all of my debt paid off before I started investing. I just made sure I had a solid debt payoff plan plan to chip away at it, paving the way for more higher returning investments. Marc Russell who is the founder and owner of the popular financial literacy company, BetterWallet, paid off $80,000 of debt after college. $50,000 of that debt was cleared within 3 years. Russell says, “Paying off my debt was the best “promotion” I’ve ever received. Once the debt is gone, you can use that additional income to invest or spend on the things you love like vacations, without guilt.” 2. Dividend Stocks 2024 hit the ground running, with the S&P 500 reaching all-time highs within the first few weeks. But does that mean it’s wise to funnel all your savings into the stock market? Through my journey, I've learned that timing the market is a fool’s errand. Instead, dollar-cost averaging has been my mantra, allowing me to invest systematically and mitigate the risk of market volatility. I also began diving into dividend-paying stocks, particularly the Dividend Aristocrats of the S&P 500, has offered both growth and income, striking a balance between stability and profitability. Russell mentions that “It’s critical that you get in the market as early as you can. Focus less on how much you can invest but rather focus on how often you can invest. Companies like Fidelity offer tools where you can automatically invest daily, weekly, or monthly for as little as a dollar. Use that to your advantage!” 3. Banking on Banks Let’s talk about banks and their laughably low savings rates. After seeing my bank offer a measly 0.1% on savings, it was clear that settling for the status quo wasn’t going to cut it. The quest for high-yield savings accounts became a priority, underscoring the importance of not letting your money languish in underperforming accounts. Tyler Meyer, CFP® and CEO of QED Wealth Solutions, offers his thoughts on maximizing your returns, “Finding a reasonable return on your cash can be critically important…particularly if you have significant cash needs. Keeping money in a traditional savings account is rarely the answer, however typically banks will offer money market accounts or CDs with significantly higher interest rates.” Investors should also be aware that chasing the highest yield might now always be with time and effort. Meyer adds, “While shopping it out can certainly be helpful it is worth it to do the math on whether it is worth it. If you only keep $10k in cash, an extra 1% of yield is only an extra $100 per year.” 4. Real Estate Real estate remains a significant investment choice, drawing attention for its tangible value and potential for wealth accumulation. My investments typically skew towards digital realms, yet the stability and potential returns from physical properties continue to attract me. According to an Ameriprise FinancialAmeriprise Financial 0.0% survey reported by Yahoo Finance, approximately two-thirds of high-net-worth Americans own a second home, often utilized as vacation homes or sources of rental income. For those looking to actively engage in the real estate market, finding a mentor can provide essential insights and guidance, easing the entry into this investment area. Alternatively, platforms like Fundrise enable investors like myself to explore real estate opportunities from home, allowing for portfolio diversification through substantial, tangible assets without the need for direct management. This strategy aligns with a broader trend where real estate investment remains a preferred method for building long-term wealth. 5. Bitcoin Bitcoin Oh, Bitcoin. The year 2023 was tumultuous for cryptocurrencies, with exchanges crumbling one after another, making my Bitcoin journey a true emotional rollercoaster. Despite this, Bitcoin reached an all-time high in March, shining amidst the chaos. Recently, the Bitcoin halving event occurred, further influencing its value and availability. The introduction of new Bitcoin ETFs and increasing investments from institutional investors signify a growing acceptance and stabilization of Bitcoin in the broader financial landscape. This shift towards more mainstream investment vehicles and the significant capital inflow from institutional sources underscore a robust confidence in Bitcoin's potential, even in volatile markets. 6. Your Health Investing in one's health is an essential, non-negotiable aspect of personal and financial well-being. This importance hit home when a client's friend, who had just retired and achieved wealth, tragically passed away soon after. This unfortunate event serves as a constant reminder that all the money in the world doesn’t matter if you’re neglecting your health. Prioritizing both physical and mental health—through activities like regular exercise, healthy eating, or mental health care such as therapy—is vital. It ensures we can enjoy the fruits of our labor and effectively manage the stresses associated with maintaining and growing our investments. 7. Personal Growth From acquiring new certifications to diving deep into personal development, investing in myself has been a cornerstone of my journey. The pursuit of knowledge and skills not only enhances your value but also opens doors to opportunities previously unimaginable. For me, becoming a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) wasn’t just about adding letters behind my name; it was a transformative process that broadened my horizon and deepened my understanding of wealth building. Obtaining degrees or certifications are just a few ways you can grow personally. Pursuing a new skill, whether to advance your career or a new hobby, enhances your life in profound ways. 8. The Side Hustle Diving into side hustles has really changed how I work, turning fun activities like making YouTube videos, blogging, or creating digital products into real money-makers. It's thrilling to see your passions pay off. This is why I often encourage people to explore different side hustles rather than trying to work overtime at their current employer. Side hustles are key in today's world—they boost your income and give you more security in a constantly changing job market. If you're ready to stand out in 2024, pick a project that excites you and might also fatten your wallet.\"\n",
